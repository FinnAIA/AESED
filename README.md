# AESED
This is a open source AES256 encryption/decryption tool with error support

## How to install:
1. If you don't have python installed then make sure that you download python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
2. Run the pip_installer.bat file and wait until it says "You can close the program now!" or just let it close on its own.
3. Run the Main.py file, it should now work! if any issues arise please contact me/make a GitHub issue.

## Support:
1. I am currently working on making a portable version that you can use anywhere without needing to download python/ or any other files apart from the portable Python file.
2. I am also attempting to get the installers to work on Linux (probably just Debian) and Mac OS
