# AESED
This is a open source AES256 encryption/decryption tool with error suport

## How to install:
1. If you dont have python installed then make sure that you download python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
2. Run the pip_installer.bat file and let it complete (should only take a few seconds)
3. Run the Main.py file, it should now work! if any issues arise please contact me.

## Suport:
1. I am currently working on making a portible version that you can use anyware without needing to download python/ or any other files apart from the Portable Python file.
2. I am also attempting to get the installers to work on Linux (probably just obantu) and Mac OS
